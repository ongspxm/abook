== PROJECT: ResuMaker

---

== Overview

ResuMaker is a fast and flexible resume generator, optimised for students in the School of Computing. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added support for contextual awareness
** What it does: allows the user to *communicate with the application via slang*. The application's ability to understand slang is quite configurable. Moreover, the user can choose to *auto-populate resume entries for events that have standard information*, such as university modules or programmes.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows users to control the application using language that is more convenient for them.
** Highlights: This enhancement is built to be configurable - the user can add on to the set of slang that is understood by the application.
** Credits: ResuMaker was a team effort. The project would not be possible without the great effort displayed by the <<../AboutUs#, group>>.
